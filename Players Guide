# Dragon's Horde - Players Guide

## Character Creation

Before the game begins, you will need to create your character. On the player management screen, you can enter your name and roll dice to determine your character's attributes. These attributes will define your class:

- Warrior (high strength)

- Thief (high dexterity)

- Magician (high intelligence)

- Bard (high charisma)

You can choose your character's look from a set of available images or stick with a randomly assigned character. If playing in a large group, characters may be automatically generated from a pre-loaded list.

## Turn Mechanics

During your turn, you have two main options:

- Unwrap a Gift from the Hoard: Select one of the wrapped gifts from the central area. Unwrap the gift and reveal it to the group. After this, your turn ends.

- Use an Ability to Claim a Gift: You have an ability to attempt to steal a gift from another player. The application will help determineÂ  your success.

  - Successful Steal: You get the selected gift, and the other player will have another turn to choose or use an ability.

  - Failed Steal: If you fail, the DM will decide your fate. You may be allowed to pick a gift, or the DM may choose one for you.

  - There is no limit to how many times a gift can be stolen, but each player may only use their ability once unless otherwise determined during game play.

## Ending the Game

The game concludes when all players have had their turn. At the very end, the final gift will be presented to the DM as a gesture of appreciation for running the game.

## Rule Variants

### Key of the Chosen 
If activated, each time a player unwraps a gift, they have a chance of being chosen by the Key of the Chosen. The key is linked to their gift, and if someone steals that gift, they also take the key. The person with the key at the end of the game wins a special bonus prize.

### Cards of Redemption 
If your gift is stolen, you can either take a new gift or draw a Card of Redemption. These cards provide unique abilities that may provide you with an advantage during your turn.
