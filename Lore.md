**Proclamation from Dragon Lord Seraphina, Benevolent Ruler of the Verdant Skies, Keeper of the Glittering Hoard, Warden of the Forgotten Flames, Protector of the Realm, and Keeper of Balance**

To my beloved villagers, my devoted horde,

I, Seraphina,  have chosen to share with you a portion of my vast hoard. To make this exchange balanced and joyful, I have devised a simple scheme for each of you to follow.

The fates shall determine the order in which each of you shall proceed. When your turn arrives, you shall step forward and make your choice:

- You may unwrap a gift from the hoard and reveal its contents to all. Cherish this gift, for parting with even the smallest piece of my hoard pains me. Each treasure is precious to me, a fragment of my soul reluctantly shared.

- Should you be tempted by greed ( or mischief ) to **attempt to claim a treasure** that another has already revealed, the fates will decide whether you succeed. Know, that this choice may bring unexpected consequences, as neither triumph nor failure is without its own price.

Remember, the spirit of this game is one of joy, camaraderie, and adventure. There will be laughter, rivalry, and perhaps a few unexpected twists, but in the end, the greatest treasure is the memory of this day together.

**Dragon Lord Seraphina**
