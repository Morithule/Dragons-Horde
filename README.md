# Dragon's Horde
### White Elephant Gift Exchange Manager

Dragon's Horde is my response to being volunteered to run my company's annual gift exchange. It started as a simple management tool to run a standard white elephant gift exchange, but evolved into a D&D themed event.

Creating a management application allowed me to add some randomization to the basic rules of the white elephant gift exchange. This enabled me to add a few twists to change things up a bit. For instance, you now have a chance to fail a steal and those stolen from can receive an advantage. I've also added optional elements of a bonus gift which is awarded by a key randomly moving among the players, and additional abilities provided by card draws. The key element should increase the desire to steal and the cards will soften the blow when stolen from. And of course it wouldn't be a D&D theme without character creation and classes. And yes, your attributes do impact your success on dice rolls.

Please review the **Dragon Master's Guide** and the **Player Handbook** for full details.
